## Story of DL project:
### Inspiration
   Our journey began with a common frustration in our professional experiences: the inconsistency and inefficiency in deploying applications across different environments. We often found ourselves saying, "It works on my machine," only to encounter issues when the same application was deployed to testing or production environments. This problem sparked our interest in containerization, specifically Docker, and led us to create a Docker-like container service tailored to address these challenges.

### The Technical Challenge
   We set out to solve a significant technical challenge: creating a containerization service that ensures environment consistency, improves scalability, and simplifies the deployment process. Our goal was to develop a solution that not only addressed the issues we faced but also provided a robust and user-friendly tool for other developers.

### Timeline
   Our project spanned several two months, from initial brainstorming sessions to the final implementation and testing phases.

### Future Vision
   While we are proud of what we have achieved, we see this project as a starting point. In the next iteration, we envision creeating the Docker-Like hub.
